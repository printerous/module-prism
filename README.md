# Prism

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/prism`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
$ git submodule add https://github.com/printerous/module-prism vendor/prism


gem 'prism', '0.1.0', path: './vendor/prism'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install
